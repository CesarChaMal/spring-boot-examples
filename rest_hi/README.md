Hi REST
=======
This simple Spring Boot example includes two scripts: app.groovy and app_minified.groovy.
Essentially, these scripts are the same and will behave the same when run.
The only difference is that app_minified.groovy doesn't have any unnecessary whitespace or line breaks, thereby showing a minimal REST controller for Spring Boot CLI.

Run the example with either...

```sh
$ spring run app.groovy
```

...or...

```sh
$ spring run app_minified.groovy
```

Then point your browser, [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/), [Spring REST Shell](https://github.com/spring-projects/rest-shell), or other client at http://localhost:8080/. You should see a simple response of "Hi!".
