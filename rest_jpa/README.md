REST JPA
========
The intent of this project is to demonstrate how to use Spring Data JPA and Spring Data REST in a
Spring Boot CLI application.

Run the example with either...

```sh
$ spring run app.groovy
```

...or...

```sh
$ spring run app_minified.groovy
```

Then point your browser, [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/), [Spring REST Shell](https://github.com/spring-projects/rest-shell), or other client at http://localhost:8080/.

NOTE: At this point, it doesn't work. I'm still trying to sort out the details of why it doesn't work.
