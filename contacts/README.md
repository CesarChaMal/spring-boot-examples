Contacts
========
This is a simple rolodex-like application developed with Spring MVC, Thymeleaf templates, and Spring's JdbcTemplate used to persist contact data to an embedded H2 database.

Due to the fact that this app is composed of multiple .groovy files, it will be necessary to run it like this:

```sh
$ spring run *.groovy
```
